Police set up a DNA dragnet to trap and convict the real killer, but are stymied when Richard Buckland confesses to the crime and his DNA does not match. Later, it is discovered that the true killer, Colin Pitchfork, had avoided giving a DNA sample during the dragnet and this brings the focus on him.

The rope used to tie the boys was unique. Another clue turned up when a brother of one of the boys was hypnotized and remembered a uniformed man in a tan car. Shortly after, someone noticed a strange car and gave the licence plate number to police. This vital information led to the capture and conviction of John Joubert, an enlistee in the Air Force who carried the same exact rope used to bind the two boys.

When Mark and a friend returned home that evening, they found Karla dead. The condition of Karla's body told investigators that she was a victim of sexual assault; she had resisted and was killed. The police questioned neighbors Paul Main and John Prante, but they were considered low-level suspects. During the autopsy, they were able to re-examine bite marks found on her body. A computer enhancement gave a better view of the bite marks and the science of forensic odontology identified John Prante as the perpetrator.

Anna'a mother recalled a trip to the grocery store when Anna pointed excitedly at her favorite drink, Odwalla apple juice.

The genetic markings on the E. coli in the victims matched the bacteria found in the product bottled on that day.
